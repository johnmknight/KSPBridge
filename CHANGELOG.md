# Changelog

All notable changes to KSPBridge are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.15.1] — 2026-05-03

Patch release. Two corrections layered on the v0.15.0 schema-parity
work, plus a clean tag for everything that landed in the v0.15.0
zip after its tag was cut.

### Changed

- `broker_host` default switched from `appserv1.local` to `localhost`
  in both `Settings.cs` (the runtime fallback) and the shipped
  `Settings.cfg`. A fresh install now connects to a same-machine
  Mosquitto out of the box. Remote-broker users (homelab, VM, cloud)
  set `broker_host` to the broker's hostname or IP.
- `Settings.cfg` comments revised to match: removed homelab-specific
  references in favour of generic guidance about local vs remote
  broker setups.
- README's Installing and Configuration sections updated with the
  new defaults.

### Note

The v0.15.1 tag points at a clean head that includes everything
shipped in the v0.15.0 release zip plus the broker default change.
The v0.15.0 tag captures only the schema-parity commit; nine
post-tag commits (install-check, FDO console screenshot,
csproj DeployToKSP fix, etc.) shipped in the v0.15.0 release zip
but were not reflected in the tag. v0.15.1 fixes that drift —
its tag and zip are byte-for-byte aligned.

## [0.15.0] — 2026-05-03

First release with full KSA-Bridge schema parity. Eighteen telemetry
producers shipping.

### Added

- `dynamics` topic (5 Hz) — body-frame angular velocity (pitch / yaw /
  roll rates), body-frame linear acceleration, finite-differenced
  angular acceleration, and current g-load (from `Vessel.geeForce` so
  it matches the stock G-meter).
- `resources` topic (2 Hz) — wet / dry / resource mass plus a
  per-resource breakdown aggregated across every part on the vessel.
  All mass-bearing fields in kilograms.
- `situation` topic (1 Hz) — the eight `Vessel.situation` enum values
  expanded into individual booleans plus derived flags `onSurface`,
  `inAtmosphere`, `controllable`.
- `atmosphere` topic (5 Hz) — atmospheric density, static and dynamic
  pressure, ambient and external (heated) temperature, Mach number,
  and parent-body atmosphere context flags.
- `staging` topic (1 Hz, retained) — what fires on the next staging
  event: parts-, engine-, and decoupler-counts plus part display
  titles for both the next-to-fire stage and the one after that.
- `scripts/make-release.ps1` — KSP-mod-standard release zip builder
  driven from csproj's `<Version>` property.
- `GameData/KSPBridge/KSPBridge.version` — KSP-AVC / CKAN compatibility
  metadata. Regenerated on every release by `make-release.ps1`.
- `scripts/install-check.ps1` (with `install-check.bat` wrapper) ships
  inside `GameData/KSPBridge/` in the release zip. Walks ten
  prerequisites (KSP install detected, plugin DLLs deployed,
  KSPBridge.version parses, all four Settings.cfg fields valid, TCP
  socket open to broker, MQTT publish/subscribe round-trip succeeds,
  WebSocket listener reachable, FDO console assets present, Python
  available, `python -m http.server` actually serves the console URL)
  and prints pass/warn/fail per check with actionable remediation. On
  successful runs it offers to launch a long-running `python -m
  http.server` and open the FDO console in the browser with the
  `?broker=` query-string override pre-filled from `Settings.cfg`.
- `.ckan/KSPBridge.netkan` — CKAN indexer file ready for one-time
  submission to `KSP-CKAN/CKAN-meta`. Uses `$kref` github + `$vref`
  ksp-avc so the inflater bot auto-publishes new GitHub releases.
- README "Installing" section with Steam path hint, extract step,
  Settings.cfg edit, and verification commands (KSP.log grep,
  `mosquitto_sub`).
- README hero screenshot of the FDO console rendering live telemetry
  (`docs/images/fdo-console.png`), recapped inside the Browser
  console section.
- `?broker=` query-string override on the FDO console
  (`hardscifi-fdo-console.html` + `-cdn.html`) so the same source
  file works against a homelab default OR a localhost test broker
  without per-host edits.
- `docs/RELEASING.md` maintainer release-process guide covering
  scripted bump/build/package/publish steps plus an eight-item
  smoke-test checklist that's now anchored on
  `install-check.bat`.

### Changed

- Release zip now follows the standard KSP-mod packaging convention
  (used by Spacedock and CKAN): `LICENSE` and `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`
  live inside `GameData/KSPBridge/` rather than at the zip root, so
  extraction does not litter the user's KSP install.
- `Settings.cs` default for `BrokerPort` corrected from 1884 to 1883
  (matching the broker actually exposed on `appserv1.local`).
- `Settings.cfg` comment line about the homelab broker corrected from
  "1884 for MQTT and 9001 for WebSocket" to "1883 for MQTT and 9002
  for WebSocket" — what's actually live.
- `Plugin.Version` runtime constant aligned with `csproj` (`0.15.0`);
  `_bridge/status` payloads now report the matching version string.
- csproj `DeployToKSP` post-build target now also copies
  `KSPBridge.version`, `install-check.bat`, `install-check.ps1`,
  `LICENSE`, and `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` to the deployed mod
  folder. Previously a fresh `dotnet build` left those files
  missing in the local install even though they shipped in the
  release zip; now build-time deploy and the release zip layout
  are identical. `Settings.cfg` retains its existing
  copy-only-if-missing behaviour to preserve user customisations
  across rebuilds.

## [0.14.0] — 2026-05-03

First public GitHub release. Thirteen telemetry producers.

### Added

- `target/vehicle`, `target/state_vectors`, `target/attitude` topics
  (10 Hz) mirroring the active-vessel schemas for the selected target.
  Schemas are byte-for-byte identical to the active-vessel topics, so
  consoles built for the active vessel work for the target with zero
  parsing changes.
- `docking/context` topic (1 Hz, retained) — docking lifecycle: own /
  target docking-port `persistentId` + module index plus a coarse
  engagement state (`idle` / `armed` / `soft_dock` / `hard_dock` /
  `disabled`).
- `IRetainable` companion interface — opt-in MQTT retention for
  producers whose payloads describe state rather than streaming
  telemetry.
- `rotationX/Y/Z/W` fields on the `attitude` topic — full Unity
  quaternion of the vessel root transform, lets external 3D renderers
  pose a vessel without re-deriving rotation from heading/pitch/roll.

### Pre-0.14 history (tagged but never released to GitHub)

- **v0.13.0** — added the `target/*` trio.
- **v0.12.0** — added quaternion attitude.
- **v0.11.0** — unified multi-contour body pipeline for the bundled
  hard-scifi FDO console (Tier 1 / Tier 2 / special-case Jool).
- **v0.10.0** — `performance` topic (ΔV, TWR, mass, thrust),
  body-aware globe rendering in the console.
- **v0.8.0** — initial commit. Eight producers: `vehicle`,
  `navigation`, `attitude`, `state_vectors`, `orbit`, `parent_body`,
  `maneuver`, `encounter`.
